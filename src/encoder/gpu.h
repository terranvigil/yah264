 * Every entry point here is a no-op that reports failure when the library is
 * not linked (-Dgpu=disabled), when Metal is unavailable, or when the runtime
 * knob is not armed -- so call sites need no #ifdef and the CPU path stays
 * complete and default. That is the contract in
 * docs/gpu-shared-library-design.md, and the conformance gate rests on it.
 *
 * Scope, deliberately narrow: this replaces the WIDE INTEGER half of the lowres
 * search and nothing else. Our lowres is quarter-pel and the library's search is
 * integer-pel, and that precision is load-bearing (it is why blk8_inter_coh
 * exists), so the GPU supplies a starting MV from an exhaustive integer window
 * and the CPU keeps its subpel refinement around it.
 *
 * THE API IS SPLIT SUBMIT/WAIT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. The first version
 * of this was synchronous and measured 1.86x SLOWER at t12 -- at a search range
 * where the GPU did essentially no work it was still 1.33x, because blocking the
 * driver before the Phase-A parallel_for converts work that ran across twelve
 * pool threads into serial waiting. A GPU offload that does not overlap the CPU
 * cannot pay however fast its kernels are. the local measurement records.

 * The eighth attempt's shape, and the one the seven refusals point at
 * (the local measurement records "do not reattempt without..."): submit at
 * PUSH time, when every leg pairing the new frame with the previous
 * bframes+1 frames has both inputs present (the pipelined warm's
 * input-availability refusal does not apply), and collect at WALK time,
 * frames later, so the ~2 ms DVFS round cost is hidden behind the slack
 * instead of being beaten (the synchronous refusals do not apply). Each push
 * submits one round of 2*reach SEARCHQ legs -- the superset of every leg any
 * walk can later want, since push order == display order and a walk leg's
 * display distance is at most bframes+1.
 *
 * The kernel returns, per 8x8 lowres block, the distortion-argmin QUARTER-pel
 * MV with its SATD plus the zero-MV SATD (NGC_JOB_SEARCHQ); the consumer
 * prices rate between those two candidates with its own chained predictor.
 * So the CPU-side Phase A search -- diamonds, satds, and the subpel phase
 * plane builds -- is DELETED for covered legs, not seeded.
 *
 * DETERMINISM CONTRACT. Whether a leg is covered must not depend on timing,
 * because the warm and the walk memoize each other's results: coverage is a
 * pure function of (push distance <= reach, round still resident, submits
 * healthy). The round ring holds nslots + 2*reach rounds -- strictly more
 * than any consumer can reach back -- and any GPU failure flips the handle
 * STICKY-dead (a loud one-time warning; output can differ from a healthy run
 * only across a hardware failure, the same caveat the CPU fallback always
 * carries).
 *
 * Threading: push is called by the lookahead chain only (single-threaded,
 * in push order); field by anyone (driver, pool workers) -- it fence-waits
 * the round on first touch under the handle's mutex, which is a no-op frames
 * after the submit. */
