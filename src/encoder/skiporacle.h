 * At a low-bitrate operating point 42.6% of P and 62.0% of B macroblocks end up
 * coded as skip, but our early probe catches only ~16% of each; the rest run a
 * full ME + intra + RD tournament and are then discarded. x264 catches its skips
 * up front (a lambda-scaled gate plus a decimate-tolerant probe) and that is why
 * its satd volume falls 32% into low bitrate while ours does not move.
 *
 * "Write a better early test" is a quality question and needs a BD round. But
 * "what is a better early test WORTH" is answerable exactly, with no quality
 * argument at all: record each MB's final verdict, replay it as an early exit,
 * and time that. Where the verdict is skip either way the reconstruction is the
 * same P_Skip/B_Skip, so a correct oracle run is BYTE-IDENTICAL to a normal one
 * -- which is also the check that the oracle is wired up honestly. Its wall time
 * is the ceiling any early-skip predictor can reach.
 *
 * Y264_SKIP_ORACLE=<path> pass 1 (file absent) records, pass 2 (present) replays.
 * Measurement only; never on in a shipping path.
