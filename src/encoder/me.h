 * 3), which the row gate guarantees are consumable (final rows >= 16(r+LAG)+13
 * when it releases).
 *
 * Y264_STAIR_LAG below is the FLOOR, not the value in force: the value used at
 * runtime is yah264_encoder_t.stair_lag, computed once per encoder_open by
 * stair_lag_for (encoder.c) as a function of frame height and pool width --
 * the same device x264 uses to bound its inter-thread MV range -- and never allowed below
 * this floor. The soundness argument for ANY lag >= this floor is a closed
 * form, not a re-measurement: the row-gate's producer-side publish bound
 * (16(r+LAG)+13 luma / +10 hpel / 8(r+LAG)+6 chroma, stair_trailer_task) and
 * this macro's reader-side touch bound both scale by exactly 16 per unit of
 * LAG, so the slack between them (19/16/10 rows) is a LAG-independent
 * constant -- raising the runtime value can never erode it. Lowering the
 * FLOOR itself is the thing that needs new arithmetic, which is exactly what
 * this constant still guards.
 *
 * The #ifndef is a HEADROOM PROBE hook only (-DY264_STAIR_LAG=k in a scratch
 * build dir): the margin above leaves 2 rows of rec / 1 of hpel slack at LAG 4,
 * so any k < 4 reads unwritten rows and its OUTPUT IS UNSOUND. It exists to
 * price a shorter chain, which measured 1.01x on CIF. Never ship k != 4 without
 * re-deriving the margin arithmetic (that includes never lowering the runtime
 * floor below it). */
