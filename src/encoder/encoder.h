 * that turn the multi-frame machinery on is not (measured 559 -> 433 ms on

 *

 *
 * The floor is 2, priced down from 8 one step at a time, each step measured:
 * floor 6 at t6 is 21-30% faster than floor 8 (bus 0.177->0.124s, foreman
 * 0.155->0.108, samsung 0.563->0.442) and flips all three cells to BEAT

 * (0.222s, 1.04x).
 * Thread counts above each step stay byte-identical across it, every lowered
 * floor is deterministic under load, and size moves at most +-0.3% (the
 * engaged mechanisms are the band-priced ones). 2 is the terminal value --
 * la_pool_min's own floor is 2 for the same reason ("a lead with no pool at
