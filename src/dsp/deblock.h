 * sets have_left / have_top is promising those are inside the frame.

 * The nnz fold needs one more column and row than the strengths do (an 8x8
 * transform's coded status is its whole quadrant's, and the neighbour column's
 * quadrant partner sits at bx0-2), which is why this takes the grids and their
