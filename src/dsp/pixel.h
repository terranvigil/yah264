 * Where the win comes from is NOT the same as sad_x4's, and it is worth being
 * precise because it bounds the payoff: SAD is load-bound, so sharing one
 * source load across four references is most of its 1.6-1.8x. SATD does ~5x
 * more arithmetic per byte loaded, so shared loads are worth much less; what
