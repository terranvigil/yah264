 * WHY THIS IS A KERNEL AND NOT A HELPER. deblock.c used to derive each edge's
 * bS on demand behind a lazy memo: a call, six strided grid reads and a chain
 * of early-outs, up to thirty-two times per macroblock. Measured on the
 * as-shipped t1 profile that was 1.1-1.2% of wall in `strength` alone, inside
 * a deblock stage costing 2.2-3.3% against x264's ~0.5%
 * (the local measurement records). x264 vectorises exactly this job and we
 * had no kernel for it, which is what put it at the top of the coverage list.
 *
 * The whole-macroblock shape is what makes a kernel possible: all sixteen
 * vertical and sixteen horizontal strengths come out of one pass over a 5x5
 * window of the motion and coefficient grids, and every test in 8.7.2.1 is a
 * lane-wise compare. Deriving all thirty-two is more arithmetic than the memo
 * did when the 8x8 transform lets the luma loops skip the odd internal edges,
 * and still cheaper, because the memo's cost was per-edge overhead rather
 * than the derivation.

 * whole 8x8 quadrant's, the same fold the decoder does. `tr8` is the flag of
 * the macroblock that OWNS the block, which for the left column and top row is
 * the neighbour's. Negative coordinates round down (-1 & ~1 == -2), which is
 * the neighbour quadrant's first column, so the fold needs no special case. */
