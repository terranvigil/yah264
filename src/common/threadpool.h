 * - every cell (row, col') with col' < col has already returned.
 * That is the H.264 raster dependency (left + top + top-right neighbours), so a
 * cell observes identical neighbour state regardless of nthreads -> the result is
 * byte-identical to a serial raster scan. The call blocks until every cell is done.
 *
 * `thread_init(ctx, thread_idx)`, if non-NULL, runs once on each participating
 * worker before it processes any cell of THIS wavefront -- use it to install
 * thread-local per-worker state (e.g. the ME half-pel context). thread_idx is in
 * [0, nthreads).
 *
 * `cell_fn` also receives the worker's thread_idx so it can select per-worker
 * scratch (e.g. a private copy of the frame struct) without thread-locals.

 * on the immediately-preceding (lower-numbered, already-claimed) row.

 * v2 (multi-frame): the pool holds a small table of concurrent jobs -- every
 * ntp_wavefront / ntp_parallel_for call registers one and blocks until it
 * completes, and calls may overlap from different threads. ONE worker set
 * serves them all: an idle worker claims the next READY row from the OLDEST
 * job that has one (drain order bounds latency), so a stalled frame never
 * parks a worker another frame could use. With a single registered job this
 * reduces exactly to the classic wavefront above.
 *
 * When a claimed row stalls mid-row and other work is runnable, the worker
 * PARKS the row (a resumable continuation) and serves the other frame; only
 * the same worker later resumes it, so row-carried per-worker state survives.
 * Re-entering a job after running another one calls `thread_attach` (re-
 * install cheap thread-locals, e.g. the ME hpel registry) -- thread_init runs
 * only before FRESH rows, where all row state re-seeds. A job that has a
 * thread_init but no thread_attach is never parked (its rows stall in place,
 * v1 behaviour).
 *
 * ntp_wavefront_gated additionally takes an external per-row claim gate: row
 * `r` is only claimed once row_ready(gate_ctx, r) returns nonzero. The
 * predicate is called under the pool's internal mutex, so it must be cheap,
 * non-blocking and MONOTONIC (once true for a row it must stay true -- e.g.
 * an atomic watermark read). Whoever advances the gate's source must call
 * ntp_pool_kick so parked workers re-evaluate. Used by the staircase: a B
 * frame's rows gate on the in-flight anchor's published consumable rows.
