 * Persistent worker pool + deterministic MB-row wavefront. See threadpool.h.
 *
 * Multi-frame: ONE worker set serves a small table of concurrent JOBS
 * (wavefronts or parallel-fors). Each job keeps its own in-job wavefront
 * dependency state (`progress`) plus an optional external per-row claim gate
 * (`row_ready`, e.g. the staircase's published-anchor-rows watermark). An idle
 * worker claims the next READY row from the OLDEST job that has one -- a row
 * is ready when its external gate is open and the row above has produced its
 * first cells -- so frames drain oldest-first and a gate-blocked frame never
 * parks a worker that another frame could use.
 *
 * PARKING (what makes the overlap real): when a claimed row stalls mid-row on
 * the row above and other work is runnable, the worker parks the row as a
 * resumable continuation (row, column, needed progress) and serves the other
 * frame; the wavefront's lag-chain bubbles become cross-frame throughput
 * instead of sleep. A parked row is WORKER-BOUND: the analyze run functions
 * keep row-carried per-worker state (the CABAC est_ctx advances across a row
 * in the worker's private engine copy), so only the owning worker may resume
 * it, and while it holds a parked row of job J it takes no other unit of J
 * (which would clobber that state). Re-entering a job after running another
 * one triggers `thread_attach` (re-install cheap thread-locals, e.g. the ME
 * hpel registry) -- never `thread_init`, which would reset row-carried state;
 * jobs providing thread_init but no thread_attach are simply never parked.
 *
 * Within a job nothing changes: rows are claimed in increasing order and
 * processed left-to-right; before cell (r,c) the worker waits until row r-1
 * has completed c+2 cells, tracked in the job's atomic `progress` array with
 * the per-row wake-slot + seq_cst-fence discipline that fixed the 9b6251f
 * lost wakeup (see run_row_from). With a single registered job there is never
 * an alternative unit, so nothing parks and this reduces exactly to the v1
 * wavefront -- same claim order, same cell schedule, byte-identical output
 * (worker identity never reaches the bitstream -- the determinism invariant).

 * - an idle worker polls `work_epoch`, bumped by every producer event that
 * can open a claim (job registration, kick, a row crossing its start
 * need, the cascade), then re-scans under the mutex.
 * The budget is ~the wake round-trip: spinning longer than a sleep+wake
 * costs can never pay. Scheduling-only: claim rules, wake protocol and the
 * lost-wakeup proof are untouched (a fruitless spin falls into the same
 * register+fence+re-scan+sleep path). Workers holding parked
