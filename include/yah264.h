/* The sample width is a compile-time type INSIDE the encoder, so there are two
 * libraries -- an 8-bit one and a 10-bit one -- and a program may link both.
 * What this header no longer does is type the samples for the caller. There is
 * no public `pixel`: picture planes are void*, their stride is in samples, and
 * the width of a sample is whichever library you called. That is what lets one
 * yah264_picture_t serve both depths, and it is why the old failure mode -- a
 * 10-bit library loaded under a header that had typed `pixel` as uint8_t, so
 * every plane was read at half its stride -- cannot happen any more.
 *
 * WHICH library a call reaches is decided here, by the Y264_BIT_DEPTH this
 * header is compiled with: the 10-bit library's public names carry a `_10`
 * suffix and YAH264_API renames the calls. An external consumer sees no change
 * -- it writes yah264_encoder_open() either way -- and gets the right value
 * from pkg-config's Cflags (`yah264`, or `yah264_10`). A consumer that wants
 * BOTH libraries in one program is in the CLI's position: it compiles at 8 and
 * declares the suffixed entry points itself, which is what YAH264_API is
 * published for. yah264_bit_depth() still answers for a library linked by

/* Chroma sampling (planar Y, Cb, Cr).

 * format you asked for. The numbering is deliberately SPARSE for that reason:
 * the gaps are x264's formats we do not implement (I400, NV12/NV21, YV12/YV16,
 * packed YUYV/UYVY/V210, YV24, and the RGB family), and every one of them is
 * REJECTED by yah264_encoder_open rather than approximated. A ported csp
 * therefore either encodes the format you named or fails to open. There is no
 * value that quietly encodes something else.
 *
 * What is NOT adopted is x264's flag machinery. X264_CSP_MASK, _VFLIP and
 * _HIGH_DEPTH are bits layered on top of these values, and this encoder
 * implements none of them -- bit depth is a compile-time property here
 * (Y264_BIT_DEPTH). `X264_CSP_I420 | X264_CSP_HIGH_DEPTH` is not 4:2:0 to us,

/* ===========================================================================
 * PORTING x264 CODE? READ THIS FIRST.
 *
 * yah264_param_t does not share x264's numbering. Several fields take values
 * that are legal in both encoders and mean DIFFERENT THINGS in each. Because
 * the ported value is always in range, the assignment compiles, the encode
 * succeeds, and you get a different tool than you asked for -- no error, no
 * warning, nothing in the bitstream to say so. You find out from the file size.
 *
 * NONE OF THIS APPLIES TO THE CLI, which is x264-compatible and maps every
 * flag onto the values below for you. The trap is the C API alone.
 *
 * There are two shapes of it.
 *
 * (1) OFF IS A NEGATIVE, NOT ZERO.
 *
 * Twenty fields in this struct read zero as "unset, pick the default", so
 * zero was never available to mean off. x264 spells both of these off as
 * zero. Use the constants and you cannot get it backwards:
 *
 * scenecut 0 here = the default 40 (x264's own aggressiveness).
 * x264's --scenecut 0 = off. Off here:
 * YAH264_SCENECUT_OFF.
 *
 * sync_lookahead inverted in BOTH directions. 0 here = auto (a lead of
 * bframes+1); x264's 0 = off. Negative here = off;
 * x264's -1 (its auto value) = auto. Porting
 * either value gets you the other behaviour. Off here:
 * YAH264_SYNC_LOOKAHEAD_OFF.
 *
 * Any negative value means off, so a bare negative works as well as the
 * constant.
 *
 * (2) THE ENUMS CARRY x264'S VALUES.
 *
 * rc.method, me_method, direct and csp use x264's numbering, and the cases
 * x264 has that this encoder does not are REJECTED by yah264_encoder_open
 * instead of being narrowed to something nearby. Every ported value either
 * does what it says or fails to open.
 *
 * A caller compiled against an ABI-version-0 header (the pre-x264 numbering)
 * and linked against this one passes the old numbers and gets the wrong tool
 * -- the exact failure this numbering exists to remove, pointed the other
 * way. RECOMPILING IS MANDATORY, not optional. See YAH264_ABI_VERSION below
 * and docs/options.md.
 *
 * Two values are ours alone and are deliberately parked where no future
 * x264 addition can reach them:
 *
 * YAH264_RC_2PASS (100) x264 has no 2-pass rc method; it spells 2-pass
 * as ABR plus b_stat_read/b_stat_write. Parked
 * far above X264_RC_*'s dense range so a fourth
 * x264 method cannot land on it.
 *
 * YAH264_ME_AUTO (-1) x264 has no auto; its me_method is always
 * explicit. Any non-negative home for auto is a
 * seat X264_ME_* might one day want (it already
 * uses 0..4), so auto is negative -- which is
 * also how this struct already spells auto for
 * subpel and sync_lookahead.
 *
 * What still does not line up, and cannot be fixed by renumbering:
 *
 * rc.rf x264's rate factor is a float; this is a `double`, so
 * porting a float CRF works. Double rather than float on
 * purpose: assigning x264's float to it is exact. 0 means
 * "CRF not armed" rather than x264's lossless --crf 0;
 * that is the zero-as-unset convention of class (1), not a
 * scale problem.
 *
 * subme NOT renumbered and NOT inverted. The scale runs the same
 * direction as x264's subpel level (higher = slower, more
 * RD) and the tiers line up. The only disagreement is at
 * zero: 0 here is the library default 10, the SLOWEST
 * setting, where x264's 0 is a real mode and its FASTEST.
 * That is class (1) above -- zero-as-unset -- shared with
 * nineteen other fields, so it is left alone deliberately.
 * Porting 0 for speed maximises effort. Ask for 1.
 *
 * Fields not listed agree with x264 at zero, or have no x264 equivalent.
