# Design

## The conformance gate

Everything else on this page is a choice I made. This one is a rule, and it is
the reason the rest can be trusted.

Every frame yah264 reconstructs must be bit-exact against an independent
decoder. The gate is a script rather than a push hook: the test CI runs on
manual dispatch, because Actions minutes are metered (the site build is the one
job that runs on push), so the discipline is that the gate runs before a change
is called done. The encoder writes its own
reconstruction with `--dump-recon`, ffmpeg's H.264 decoder decodes the same
bitstream, and the two must be identical byte for byte, across every clip in the
suite and a range of QPs. The encode is lossy, so the decode does not match the
input. What must match is decoder output against encoder reconstruction.

This is worth the trouble because of what an encoder is. The encoder contains a
whole decoder, and every frame predicts from the reconstruction. A single bit of
drift between the two sides compounds. The next frame predicts from something
the decoder does not have, and the error grows
until the picture falls apart. Drift does not announce itself in a quality
metric either. It looks like a slightly worse encode until it looks like a
broken one.

## The pipeline

yah264 is a many-core pipeline: a staged pipeline rather than a macroblock loop
with threads bolted on. Each stage owns one kind of decision, and the stages
are where parallelism is expressed.

The lookahead runs first. It makes a downscaled analysis pass over a window of
future frames to decide frame types, detect scene cuts, and build the
macroblock-tree propagation data that later stages spend. Nothing downstream can
be smarter than what the lookahead saw.

Behind it, per-frame work runs GOP-parallel while rows within a frame run as a
wavefront, with a lock-free pool feeding both. Output is byte-identical across
runs at a fixed thread count, which matters more than it sounds: a determinism
failure and a correctness failure look identical from the outside, and only one
of them is a bug in the coding tools. The thread count is part of the
configuration, not a free variable: `--threads 1` is its own mode and its
output differs from two threads and up.

## Threading

Asking an encoder for every core can make it slower, and the reason is that a
picture can only absorb so much concurrency before the coordination costs more
than the work. A wavefront over a CIF frame runs out of independent rows quickly.
A 1080p frame has more to give.

The thread count is chosen in two steps. Auto resolves to the smaller of the
online core count and 16, and the resolved number is then capped by what the
picture can absorb: 12 for CIF, 21 for 720p, 32 for 1080p. Only the CIF cap
ever binds under auto, since auto is already at or below 16; the other two
matter when a caller asks for a count explicitly, which is honoured and then
clamped.

The 16 is a conservative default rather than a measured knee, and it is worth
saying which. Wavefront scaling is bounded by the picture's critical path long
before it is bounded by the machine, and on an asymmetric machine the last few
workers land on efficiency cores and lengthen that path outright, so the
ceiling is set to a number that is safe on an unknown box rather than the
largest that ever helped on a known one. The measurement behind it is CIF-sized:
18 threads there read 6 to 11% worse than 8, because the extra workers contend
for a diagonal that cannot feed them. We have not measured a machine with more
than 18 cores.

Occupancy is also why the speed numbers need reading carefully. On foreman_cif
yah264 fills around 8.8 cores where x264 fills 5.8, which is where that clip's
sub-parity row comes from. Held to one thread each, the advantage is gone and
the same clip reads slower. Part of the speed picture is per-unit efficiency and
part is occupancy, and they only separate when both are measured.

The [interactive threading page](threading.html) walks the model with live
diagrams.

## Rate control

CQP, CRF, single-pass ABR, CBR and VBV, capped VBR, capped CRF and two-pass all
ship. Capped CRF is the one that gets used most, and it is also the one with the
most interesting mechanism.
[How video encoding works](encoding.md) covers what each mode is for. What is
specific to this encoder is where the intelligence sits.
Macroblock-tree is on by default. The lookahead works out which blocks later
frames will predict from and gives them a finer quantizer, because a bit spent
on a block that fifty frames inherit is worth more than one nothing references.
Variance adaptive quantization runs alongside it, moving bits toward flat areas
where quantization shows first. The mode decision's lambda is modulated per
macroblock from the same signal, and that is a good deal of the quality
difference against x264.

Under capped CRF the encoder codes to the quality target, and the buffer can
only take bits away. Where the ceiling never binds anywhere in the stream you
get the CRF encode you asked for, bit for bit, at the same thread count; a cap
that bites once changes everything after it, and every GOP after the first
opens on a half-full buffer, which costs a few bits on its own. Where the
ceiling is tight, a per-frame budget pulls the buffer back toward half full.
Nothing else under CRF watches the bit count, so without that budget the buffer
would drain until every prediction error became an underflow.

The compliance gate is six clips by three caps by both VBV paths, and it passes
29 of those 36 cells. The reference encoder is clean on the 18
cells its own feature set covers, so the two are not one ratio against another;
the seven we fail are tight-cap and mid-stream scene-cut cells and they are
tracked in `docs/rate-control.md`.

**Across shots.** The base QP under CRF is flat per frame type; what moves it
between shots is the frame mean of the per-macroblock offsets, which carries
the mb-tree boost and the adaptive-quantisation energy term. The energy
term's frame mean is applied at full strength on the anchor's base QP
(B frames inherit it through the cascade) so that a busy shot codes a little
cheaper and a quiet one a little better, the way x264's constant-quality mode
behaves; its within-frame part keeps the gentler strength that won on
single-shot clips. On file input `--cut-split` puts an IDR on every cut the
pre-scan finds and `--shot-crf` gives each shot its own CRF from the shot
table. Numbers on the results page.

## Mode decision and motion estimation

Every candidate partitioning of a macroblock is costed as distortion plus
lambda times rate, and the cheapest wins. Three things separate encoders.

- Which candidates are worth trying.
- How accurately the rate term is estimated before the entropy coder has run.
- Where the search is allowed to stop early.

Motion search runs diamond, hexagon or uneven multi-hexagon depending on the
preset, seeded from the vectors of neighboring blocks. Subpel refinement
follows at the level the preset sets. Full trellis RDOQ runs over both transform
sizes, and the transform size itself is chosen per macroblock by RD with a cheap
screen in front of it.

The cost function also carries a psychovisual term, on by default at strength
2.0, which rewards a block for keeping the source's texture energy rather than
only for minimising error. It is worth saying out loud because it is twice the
strength the reference runs and because it trades pixel accuracy for apparent
detail, which is exactly the trade a VMAF-scored board is least likely to
notice. That is what the PSNR-Y floor on the [results page](results.html) is
watching. `--tune psnr` turns it off.

## The SIMD tier

The SIMD path is about 2,800 lines of NEON intrinsics across five files, with
every kernel validated against the C reference and benchmarked through a
checkasm harness. Choosing intrinsics over hand-written assembly is a deliberate
trade with a known cost: the compiler schedules instructions and allocates
registers, which is where x264's assembly still wins.

## Decoder

The tree already contains a decoder, but it exists to verify the encoder rather
than to be one: it decodes our own output for the conformance gate above and
has never been benchmarked as a decoder. There is no standalone decode CLI, and
no number on this site is a decode number. Making it fast is a separate track
and it has not started (`docs/decoder-speed-plan.md`).
