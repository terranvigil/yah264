# Results

The measurements were taken on Apple Silicon. Speed ratios move
a few points between runs on the same machine.

## Reading the tables

The tables show how fast yah264 is compared to x264. Both encode the same clip
at the same quality. 1.0 means a tie. Lower is faster. These numbers come from
Apple Silicon. On other hardware they may shift a little.

The goal is made up of four metrics:

| metric | bar |
|---|---|
| median speed | 1.00x or faster |
| worst-clip speed | under 1.15x |
| quality | within 0.5 [VMAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Multimethod_Assessment_Fusion) |
| compression | within 1.0% size |

Two things to keep in mind when reading these tables. First, the rates are only
matched approximately, so tiny quality differences - hundredths of a VMAF
point - are smaller than the test can measure. Second, the same machine gives
slightly different times on every run and that jitter is bigger than some of
the gaps. This is why we run the measurement multiple times for confirmation.

## Why the rate control mode changes the answer

You can ask an encoder for a quality level and let the bitrate land where it
lands. That's CRF, and it's the main table. Or you can ask for a bitrate and let
quality land where it lands. That's ABR, in the second table. The two answer
different questions so both are here.

The main table is CRF. It's solved per clip so it lands on the same bitrate
as x264.

**CRF, matched achieved bitrate**, ten clips (three CIF, four 720p, three 1080p). fourpeople_720p holds the slot samsung_720p used to (samsung was vendor material with no licence; fourpeople is Xiph derf, fetchable, and reads the same ratio in that slot):

| goal | configuration | median | max | VMAF | size | status |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|
| 1 | pure C, single-threaded | **0.92x** | 1.15x | +0.26 | −0.1% | worst clip at the bar |
| 2 | pure C, multi-threaded | **0.84x** | 1.06x | +0.20 | +0.1% | all metrics pass |
| 3 | as-shipped SIMD, multi-threaded | **0.96x** | 1.16x | +0.22 | +0.0% | worst clip past the bar by 0.01 |

The worst clip on every row is the same one, low-bitrate 1080p (sunflower at
1.5 Mbit/s), with shields at 2.3 Mbit/s next; the high-bitrate 1080p rows are
the fastest cells on the board. The multi-threaded pure C row meets all four
metrics; the single-threaded pure C row has its worst clip at the 1.15x bar
and the shipped build's reads 1.16x on this board (1.15x on two reads of
the previous board). Those hundredths are the board's own
run-to-run spread on one clip, not the swap: fourpeople reads 1.04x in
samsung's slot, the same as samsung did. Goal 3's worst-clip metric is the
one open number. Before the 1080p clips joined, this table was taken on
six clips with no 1080p in it and read 0.95x / 0.85x / 0.96x. The full
per-clip tables are kept in our local board notes.

**ABR, matched achieved bitrate**, taken after the rate controller's opening was refitted (see below). This table is the last clean read and still has samsung in the 720p slot: the multi-threaded ABR tiers were re-read three times with fourpeople and every read came back with the board's own "box loaded" warning on several cells, so they are not quoted; the single-threaded tier reproduced (0.93x / 1.15x) and fourpeople's cell read 0.85x there. A quiet re-read replaces this table.

| goal | configuration | median | max | VMAF | size |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 1 | pure C, single-threaded | 0.93x | 1.14x | +0.34 | −0.1% |
| 2 | pure C, multi-threaded | 0.90x | 1.08x | +1.23 | +0.1% |
| 3 | as-shipped SIMD, multi-threaded | 1.07x | 1.23x | +1.25 | +0.1% |

Here x264's target is solved so it lands on the bitrate we achieved, which is
what the size column shows. No goal is set against this table, but it is now a
speed reading rather than a bit-spending contest. Single-threaded, ABR costs us
nothing over CRF. Multi-threaded it now costs about 0.1 to 0.15 on the ratio,
down from 0.3 to 0.4: the rate-control decide was allowed to run one burst
ahead, and then a staircase device that lets the next frame start
against a reference still being coded, which rate control had been refusing,
was allowed under that lag. That second change alone took the
multi-threaded rows from 1.06x and 1.26x to 0.94x and 1.11x. Before those changes
this table handed both encoders the same target and let the sizes differ by
about 3%, which made it unreadable as a speed number.

The rate controller's opening was refitted at the same time. Its cumulative rate
factor never forgets the first second, and the old resolution-only seed opened
the high-bitrate cells near QP 6 to 17 against operating points of 27 to 34
(and samsung five QP too high), which is where the earlier −14% / +18% rate
misses came from. The opening is now fitted at the first decide on the
lookahead window's inter cost and the target bits per macroblock (fit on
seventeen non-board cells, the board held out). On the ten board clips at
their ABR rates the median absolute rate error went from 12.5% to 6.6%
multi-threaded (x264: 5.6%) and from 7.5% to 3.8% single-threaded (x264:
4.0%), with a 2% median BD-rate gain at matched rate. The table above is the
first board after that change; it moved the ratios by 0.01 to 0.04.

**By resolution class**, median ratio on the same two boards (three CIF, four
720p, three 1080p clips):

| goal | CRF CIF | CRF 720p | CRF 1080p | ABR CIF | ABR 720p | ABR 1080p |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 1 | 0.93x | 0.90x | 1.07x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 1.09x |
| 2 | 0.78x | 0.86x | 1.00x | 0.90x | 0.87x | 1.04x |
| 3 | 0.92x | 0.99x | 1.10x | 1.07x | 1.02x | 1.18x |

Resolution is not what orders these rows. Bitrate is: the slow cells are the
low-bitrate HD ones and the high-bitrate 1080p cells are the fastest on the
board. The 1080p column reads high because two of its three clips are
low-bitrate.

## The three speed goals

Goal 2 has passed all four metrics; goal 1 has its worst clip at the bar. Goal 3 has been passing but not
consistently, so we are leaving it open.

## How to reproduce them

Both encoders run inside a single ffmpeg process and each decides how many CPU
cores to use.

We don't set the core count by hand, even though that sounds like the right
move for repeatable results. In reality, each encoder picks its thread count
differently, based on its own implementation and optimizations.

The pure-C rows need one adjustment to be fair. x264 turns off auto-vectorization
in its own C, because that C is only a fallback behind its hand-written assembly.
We strip that flag so the compiler treats both sides the same. Leave it in and
goal 2 reads about 0.73x, which measures a compiler flag rather than an encoder.

The wrapper that runs both encoders in one process lives in an ffmpeg fork, not
in this repository, for licence reasons. `make parity-status-crf` runs the
two-CLI version instead and needs no fork.

## Quality across the rate range

Quality is scored with VMAF, which predicts how good video subjectively looks to
people. We compare both encoders at the same file size.

yah264 does best at low bitrates: it beats x264 on 9 of 10 clips there, by around
12% on the standard compression score. That score is an average across a range of
settings. The lead fades as bitrate rises and is gone at the top. Any
compression claim from this project should say which bitrate range it came from.

And file size is half the story. It says nothing about encoding time. Every
quality number here sits next to a speed number.

## The hardware mode

`--hw videotoolbox` encodes through the Mac's fixed-function H.264 engine
with yah264's options mapped onto it and our scene-cut driving its keyframes.
The stream is the hardware's, not ours, so nothing above applies to it; this
is its own row, measured on the same ten clips at the same bitrates
on an Apple M-series machine. VMAF is the NEG variant.

| clip | kbit/s target | yah264 wall | yah264 CPU | hardware wall | hardware CPU | yah264 VMAF | hardware VMAF |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| foreman_cif | 400 | 0.11 s | 0.81 s | 0.16 s | 0.04 s | 93.9 | 93.3 |
| bus_cif | 400 | 0.11 | 0.68 | 0.15 | 0.04 | 93.3 | 86.5 |
| stefan_cif | 400 | 0.07 | 0.39 | 0.12 | 0.03 | 90.1 | 86.0 |
| ducks_720p | 25000 | 1.46 | 15.25 | 0.53 | 0.25 | 91.9 | 84.9 |
| park_joy_720p | 12000 | 1.16 | 11.85 | 0.43 | 0.27 | 90.4 | 82.6 |
| fourpeople_720p | 1200 | 0.57 | 6.04 | 0.50 | 0.25 | 89.8 | 85.6 |
| shields_720p | 2200 | 0.69 | 7.25 | 0.42 | 0.27 | 94.7 | 88.6 |
| sunflower_1080p | 1500 | 0.68 | 8.41 | 0.42 | 0.28 | 90.8 | 87.5 |
| pedestrian_1080p | 2800 | 0.79 | 10.45 | 0.41 | 0.22 | 87.4 | 85.1 |
| riverbed_1080p | 12500 | 1.34 | 16.44 | 0.42 | 0.23 | 88.2 | 78.7 |

Six-second windows, our encoder at auto threads. The hardware uses 13 to 70
times less CPU and is two to three times faster in wall time on HD (slower
on CIF, where the session's setup is most of the run), and it lands 1 to 8
VMAF points below our encoder at the same bitrate on eight of the ten clips,
level on the other two. The quality columns are a second read on the current
build after the rate-control opening was refitted (our riverbed figure rose
from 82.8 to 88.2 with it); the timing columns are the earlier read. The hardware is not byte-stable run to run and its quality
moves with it: riverbed read 83.0 on one run and 78.7 on the next at
the same size. Sizes are within a few percent of target on both sides; the
full per-clip figures are in our local records. VMAF is the v0.6.1 NEG model
throughout this page; x264 is r3223 at `--preset medium`, its stock build for
the SIMD rows and a build with assembly off and the compiler's vectoriser
left on for the pure C rows.

## Against other encoders

| encoder | pure-C 1-thread | pure-C MT | SIMD MT | quality (VMAF) | size | notes |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|
| yah264 | 0.92x | **0.84x** | 0.96x | +0.22 | +0.0% | this repo, ten-clip board |
| x264 | 1.00x | 1.00x | 1.00x | ref | ref | the reference point |
| openh264 | 0.15x | 0.98x | 0.47x | -14.2 | +4.1% | same ten clips and bitrates; a different design point |

The yah264 row is the goal table above (CRF, matched achieved bitrate). The
openh264 row is a different measurement: Cisco's encoder driven through a thin
adapter at the same ten clips and bitrates as the hardware row, six-second
windows, frame skipping off (its default under rate pressure, which would
compare videos of different lengths), each encoder at its own defaults. The
speed columns are wall time against x264 in the same three configurations; the
quality and size columns are against x264 at the same target.

Per clip, our encoder at auto threads against openh264 with SIMD at twelve
threads, VMAF-NEG:

| clip | kbit/s target | yah264 wall | yah264 CPU | openh264 wall | openh264 CPU | yah264 VMAF | openh264 VMAF |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| foreman_cif | 400 | 0.10 s | 0.78 s | 0.08 s | 0.06 s | 93.9 | 84.7 |
| bus_cif | 400 | 0.09 s | 0.66 s | 0.07 s | 0.05 s | 93.3 | 71.6 |
| stefan_cif | 400 | 0.06 s | 0.37 s | 0.04 s | 0.03 s | 90.1 | 71.0 |
| ducks_720p | 25000 | 1.31 s | 15.35 s | 1.55 s | 1.53 s | 91.9 | 76.7 |
| park_joy_720p | 12000 | 1.07 s | 12.01 s | 1.19 s | 1.17 s | 90.4 | 74.3 |
| fourpeople_720p | 1200 | 0.57 s | 6.02 s | 0.39 s | 0.38 s | 89.8 | 77.6 |
| shields_720p | 2200 | 0.65 s | 7.24 s | 0.71 s | 0.69 s | 94.7 | 79.5 |
| sunflower_1080p | 1500 | 0.64 s | 8.30 s | 0.69 s | 0.67 s | 90.8 | 72.2 |
| pedestrian_1080p | 2800 | 0.75 s | 10.46 s | 0.97 s | 0.95 s | 87.4 | 74.5 |
| riverbed_1080p | 12500 | 1.22 s | 16.64 s | 2.18 s | 2.16 s | 88.2 | 73.7 |

openh264 is a different design point (real-time and conferencing: no B-frames,
no lookahead, a light analysis) and the row has to be read as one. It uses
about a tenth of our CPU (median 0.09x) and lands 15.2 VMAF-NEG points
below us at the same bitrate (9 to 22 per clip), and 14.2 below x264. Its wall
time is 0.16x of x264's single-threaded and level with x264 multi-threaded:
its threading is per slice and these streams are single-slice, so its wall
does not fall with threads here while x264's and ours do; against our
encoder at auto threads its wall reads 1.09x. The
quality-normalised number is BD-rate, where an earlier five-clip measurement
with B-frames off on x264 read +63.7%; that figure is in our local records
and is not re-measured here.

GPU-vendor encoders are fixed-function silicon with different quality and
latency trade-offs, so they stay out of scope here.

## Across shots

The board clips are single shots. Real content is a chain of them, and how an
encoder moves bits between an easy shot and a hard one is invisible above.
Three sequences built from the board clips with hard cuts every 150 frames
(five shots each, CIF at 30 fps, 720p at 50, 1080p at 25; `scripts/make_multishot.py`
rebuilds them byte for byte) measure it: BD-rate on VMAF-NEG at CRF 22 to 34,
twelve threads, x264 medium as the control.

| sequence | yah264 before the fix vs x264 | yah264 now vs x264 | `--shot-crf` vs x264 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| five CIF shots (690 frames) | +13.4% | +4.4% | +0.2% |
| five 720p shots (750 frames) | +4.9% | +0.3% | -2.9% |
| five 1080p shots (750 frames) | +7.3% | +0.7% | +0.2% |

Positive means yah264 spends more bits than x264 at equal quality. The same
clips taken one at a time read -5.7% (CIF) and -14% (720p) in our favour, so
the whole swing was allocation across shots, not coding efficiency. The fix
puts the frame-mean part of adaptive quantisation on the frame's base QP at
full strength, for every input path including streaming; the single-shot
tables above did not move (band median +0.3%, worst +0.9%). `--shot-crf`
goes further on file input by sizing each shot against the whole title.
Reproduce: `scripts/multishot_bd.py --arms flat=env:Y264_AQ_DC=0.4 new=env: x264`.

## The corpus

The clips in the goal tables are natural video, three CIF, four 720p and three 1080p. The
wider corpus adds animation and high-motion sport, and every clip is recorded with its source
and licence.

The training set and the gate set are separate, and the gate set is test-only.
Any fitted coefficient is calibrated on the training half and reported on the
gate half, because a number fitted and reported on the same clips is not a
measurement.

## Off-corpus content

Content outside that set behaves differently enough that the only summary that
holds is a range.

Two clips both fairly called animation sit 33 BD-rate points apart. On 3D CGI
yah264 runs 25% ahead of x264 at 1.34x the time. Held at equal quality instead,
`veryfast` reaches x264 medium at 1.07x for a fifth fewer bits. On hand-drawn 2D
it runs 8% behind.

No animation result here is claimed as a single number.
`docs/animation-content.md` has the measurements and the preset-ladder rows. It is also why a preset-for-preset speed comparison stops
meaning much once content leaves the set the presets were tuned on.
