# perf-comp-crf-set.sh -- the speed comparison over the clip set in CRF, taken
# at a MATCHED OPERATING POINT rather than at a matched CRF number.
#
# WHY CRF AT ALL. CRF is what people actually run for VOD and file encoding, so
# it is the mode the headline should quote. ABR's one virtue as a benchmark is
# that it is rate-matched by construction -- a measurement convenience, not a
# reason to headline a mode most users do not choose.
#
# WHY NOT "CRF 25 vs CRF 25". Because those are two different operating points.
# Equal-CRF size divergence vs x264 measures -54.6%..+45.3% on this tree, and
# -29.7%..+11.4% even with Y264_CRF_CPLX=1 -- 41 points of spread
# (the local measurement records). A speed ratio taken there is a content-luck number:
# it times two encoders doing different amounts of work and reports the
# difference as if it were the encoders.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. Per clip, scripts/crf-solve.py sweeps CRF on each
# encoder and interpolates to a common ACHIEVED BITRATE; perf-comp.sh then times
# both AT that point. No scale alignment is needed or attempted -- the operating
# point is held fixed by measurement, not by assuming two integers agree.
#
# This is MORE rigorous than the ABR scoreboard, not less. ABR matches the rate
# but leaves quality wherever each encoder happens to land, and the corpus had
# to be hand-recalibrated to put both encoders in a band where the metric
# discriminates at all. Here the rate is matched AND the residual quality
# difference is reported as a legitimate dVMAF.
#
# WHY A BITRATE AND NOT A VMAF. Both are implemented -- POINT=vmaf runs the
# other one -- and on paper matched-VMAF is the more honest question ("same
# output quality, who is faster"). The bitrate is the headline anyway, and the
# reason is measured rather than argued:
#
#   MATCHED-VMAF DOES NOT CURRENTLY PRODUCE A COMPARABLE PAIR. Run at matched
#   VMAF on this tree, yah264 lands +22.2% (foreman_cif) and +24.4% (bus_cif)
#   in SIZE against x264, and perf-comp.sh's 5% guard fires on both -- correctly.
#   Two encodes 24% apart in bits are not doing comparable work, so a speed
#   ratio taken there measures the bit gap as much as the encoders.
#
#   That is not the BD-rate story and must not be read as one. yah264 is
#   BD-rate AHEAD of x264 medium (-2.76%). The +24% is specific to CRF mode's
#   bit ALLOCATION: at a matched rate yah264 scores 1.3-3.5 VMAF below x264
#   here, so buying back those points costs it a quarter more bits. An earlier
#   draft of this comment guessed "~3% apart, yah264 is BD-ahead" from the BD
#   number instead of measuring. It was off by 8x, and this file is exactly
#   where a plausible unmeasured constant does its damage.
#
# So POINT=vmaf is kept as a DIAGNOSTIC -- it is how the allocation gap above
# was sized -- and the headline is the bitrate, for three further reasons:
#   1. It satisfies perf-comp.sh's 5%-size guard BY CONSTRUCTION (measured
#      match: -1.7%..+0.6% across the set). That guard exists because a CRF run
#      with no bitrate target was once misread as an ABR undershoot, and the
#      right way past it is to genuinely match the bytes, not to special-case
#      it. The guard stays armed and silent rather than suppressed.
#   2. Bitrate is EXACT -- a byte count. VMAF is an estimate with its own noise
#      (a subsampled one was worth 2.5 points; see perf-comp.sh's VMAF_FPS),
#      and matching on it injects that noise into the operating point itself,
#      on top of the timing noise already being fought.
#   3. The corpus is already calibrated as per-clip bitrates, so the two
#      scoreboards sit at the same operating points and their rows can be read
#      against each other.
