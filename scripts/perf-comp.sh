# perf-comp.sh <clip.y4m> [crf] [seconds] -- head-to-head speed + quality of
# yah264 vs x264 at matched settings. Trims the clip to a known frame count,
# encodes it with both, wall-clocks each, and scores VMAF (subsampled to ~5fps).
#
# RATE CONTROL. The [crf] argument is used ONLY when neither YAH264_ARGS nor
# X264_ARGS selects a rate: pass --bitrate through those (perf-comp-set.sh does)
# and the run is ABR, and the crf argument is ignored rather than stacked on top.
# The script prints which mode it resolved. This matters because the two modes
# answer different questions: ABR compares two encoders at a MATCHED bitrate,
# where a VMAF delta is a quality result; CRF compares them at matched
# rate-factor NUMBERS, which is not a matched operating point -- the CRF scales
# are not the same scale, so the size delta is content luck (measured here:
# foreman -10%, bus +9%, park_joy +44%, sintel -55%) and the VMAF delta is not a
# quality verdict. The script now says so when the sizes diverge. Use
# scripts/bdcompare.py for quality; it normalises bits by construction.
#
# TWO SPEED MODES (SIMD does NOT affect quality -- both encoders' asm/NEON
# kernels are bit-exact with their scalar C, so VMAF/size are identical either
# way; the mode only changes the SPEED comparison):
#
#   optimized (default) -- each encoder with its CPU-SIMD on: x264's hand-asm
#                          (SSE/AVX2/NEON) vs yah264's NEON intrinsics. This is
#                          the real-world "as shipped" speed number.
#   pure-C   (PURE_C=1)  -- no hand-asm on either side, both -O3 AUTO-VECTORIZED
#                          C: x264-noasm-autovec vs yah264 YAH264_NO_ASM=1. This
#                          is the product-relevant pure-C number (a shipped pure-C
#                          yah264 is -O3 auto-vec too). NOT "both scalar" -- that
#                          mislabel + a -fno-tree-vectorize x264 flattered the gap
#                          to ~1.5x; fair is ~2.2-2.4x. Run via perf-comp-purec.sh.
#
# Note: "asm" and "SIMD" are the same category (CPU vector units) -- x264 writes
# its SIMD as hand assembly, yah264 as C intrinsics. GPU/Metal is a different
# category (a separate processor); x264 has no Metal path (only an optional,
# off-by-default OpenCL *lookahead*), so there is no x264 GPU number to compare.
#
# Prints:
#   yah264 took A s (XX fps),  x264 took B s (YY fps)
#   yah264 vmaf is xxx,  x264 vmaf is yyy
#   yah264 psnr-y is xx.xx dB,  x264 psnr-y is yy.yy dB
#
# PSNR-Y IS A FLOOR, NOT A DECISION METRIC (2026-09-14, owner). It is scored
# here because VMAF and PSNR can and do disagree -- the sibling H.265 campaign
# found them disagreeing on nine of fifteen clips while the level gap at equal
# bytes stayed small -- and an item that buys VMAF by letting pixel accuracy
# slide should be visible rather than invisible. The bar is "not more than
# 1.0 dB below x264 at equal bytes"; 0.5 dB below is recorded as debt and is
# listed, not gated. Nothing is decided on PSNR: dVMAF stays the quality leg.

# `--bitrate` on top via YAH264_ARGS/X264_ARGS (perf-comp-set.sh does exactly
# that). Two flags, two encoders, two different precedence rules: yah264 takes
# --bitrate whenever it is present regardless of order (cli/yah264_cli.c, the
# `else if (crf10 > 0)` arm is only reached when bitrate is 0), x264 takes
# whichever came LAST. They happened to agree, so the ABR runs were sound -- but
# only by luck of argument order, and nothing in the output said which mode had
# been measured. Reorder X264_ARGS and x264 silently drops to CRF while yah264
# stays in ABR, and the table still prints a confident dVMAF.
#
# It also made the bare invocation dangerously easy to misread. `perf-comp.sh
# foreman_cif.y4m 30 3` is CONSTANT-QUALITY -- there is no bitrate target in it
# at all -- yet its output was quoted in f60fd43 as yah264 "undershooting the
# bitrate target" by 11%. At equal CRF the two encoders sit at different points
# on their own RD curves and the size delta is content luck, not tracking: on
# this tree it is foreman -10%, bus +9%, sintel -55%, park_joy +44%.

    #
    # SPREAD is reported to stderr when it is wide, because a median hides a
    # cooked box: after hours of continuous benchmarking this machine has
    # returned a 5x range for one command, at which point no statistic helps.
    #
    # THE TIMER IS perf_counter, NOT `/usr/bin/time -p`, and that is not a

    # +2.3% on foreman_cif and +2.7% on stefan_cif (bench/bin_ab.py, medians of

    # the local measurement records already found this for the MAX leg and

    # Both timers bracket the same thing (fork -> exec -> reap of `sh -c cmd`),

# BOTH arms are fed the same way, and that is not cosmetic. Handing each CLI the
# y4m FILE measures its reader as well as its encoder, and the two readers are
# not comparable: on 120 frames of park_joy_720p, x264's file path spends 16.2 s
# of system time at 3.8x parallelism where ours spends 1.7 s at 7.8x. That is an
# I/O difference being scored as encoder speed, and it flatters us by a margin
# that grows with frame size -- +0.06 on the six-clip median, +0.12 on park_joy,
# +0.18 on samsung, and park_joy crosses 1.00 because of it. Feeding both from

# decode and no second pass -- the only new work is the per-frame MSE, which is
# far cheaper than the VMAF features next to it. It is also INERT for the
# existing column: the pooled vmaf mean is bit-identical with the feature on
# and off (checked to nine decimals on a CIF pair), so the dVMAF leg reproduces
# to the digit across this change rather than "within noise".
#
# It is scored on exactly the frames VMAF is scored on, because --subsample
# applies to every feature in the run. That matters: a PSNR read over a

# sampling reason and be read as the metrics disagreeing, which is the exact
