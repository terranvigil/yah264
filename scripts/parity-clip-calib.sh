# parity-clip-calib.sh -- measure the rate/VMAF ladder for ONE clip so its
# operating point can be added to scripts/parity-clips.sh.
#
# The six points in parity-clips.sh were chosen by hand from a ladder like this
# one, and the ladder was never committed -- so the next clip added to a BD
# sweep had no way to be calibrated the same way, and wasn't. sintel_720p and
# touchdown_1080p both entered BD rounds uncalibrated, and touchdown's BD fit
# then read -11.48%, -5.70% and +41.24% across three ladders of somebody's
# choosing. This script exists so "pick the point the way the other six were
# picked" is a command rather than a memory.
#
# Selection rule (verbatim from parity-clips.sh): the lowest ABR target at which
# both encoders track within a few percent AND yah264 lands in VMAF ~88-94, the
# band where the metric still discriminates and where the encoders are actually
# deployed.
#
# VMAF model is v0.6.1, matching perf-comp.sh -- the band's numbers are in that
# model's units and comparing them against a v1 or NEG score is a category
# error. (The BD *gate* is VMAF-NEG; that is a different question from where the
# operating point sits.)
#
# Both sides run the preset's own defaults, as perf-comp-set.sh does since
# 2026-08-11 -- no --ref/--bframes overrides, because the point of the exercise
# is the config a user actually gets.
#
# Usage: scripts/parity-clip-calib.sh <clip-name> <target,target,...>
#   e.g. scripts/parity-clip-calib.sh sintel_720p 1000,2000,3000,4000,6000
