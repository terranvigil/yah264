# parity-status.sh -- one scoreboard for the three owner speed-parity goals
# (docs/pure-c-speed-parity.md header; memory: speed-parity-goals):
#   GOAL 1  pure-C, single-threaded   (yah264 no-asm vs x264-noasm-autovec)
#   GOAL 2  pure-C, multi-threaded    (same binaries, all online CPUs)
#   GOAL 3  as-shipped SIMD, multi-threaded (yah264 SIMD vs x264-asm)
# Each line reports the x264-speed multiple over the 6-clip set (1.00x = parity;
# >1 means x264 is faster). Quality/size columns come from the per-tier tables.
#
# RATE CONTROL. Two scoreboards, selected by PARITY_RC:
#
#   PARITY_RC=abr (default) -- the fast fixed-rate run. Both encoders get the
#       same --bitrate; matched by construction, no calibration, quickest read.
#       Kept as the default precisely so the quick iteration loop stays quick.
#   PARITY_RC=crf           -- CRF at a MATCHED OPERATING POINT. CRF is what
#       people actually run for VOD and file encoding, so this is the number to
#       headline; ABR's virtue is measurement convenience, not user relevance.
#       It costs a per-clip calibration sweep on top (scripts/crf-solve.py
#       solves each encoder onto a common achieved bitrate), because yah264's
#       CRF N and x264's CRF N are NOT the same operating point -- 41 points of
#       size spread even after the complexity term is enabled.
#
# The two are NOT the same measurement and their numbers are not comparable. The
# opt-in is deliberate and the cost is stated rather than silently absorbed:
# after the first run the solve is cached, so the marginal cost of the CRF board
# is small, but the first run pays for the sweep.
#
# Usage: scripts/parity-status.sh [quick]
#   quick = 2 clips (foreman_cif + park_joy_720p), ~3x faster, noisier.
# Env: SET_SECONDS/SET_CRF/CLIPS pass through; NPROC overrides the MT thread
#      count; PARITY_RC=abr|crf; POINT=kbps|vmaf (crf board only).
set -uo pipefail
root="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)"
# MT THREAD COUNT: 12, not "all cores" (2026-08-17, owner).
#
# Two reasons, and the second one is a result rather than hygiene.
#
# 1. At 18-of-18 any stray desktop process steals a core directly from the
#    encode, and our pool contends differently than x264's threading does, so
#    the ratio is not invariant to it. A whole session was spent unable to
#    separate real movement from a busy box. 12 leaves headroom.
# 2. GOAL 2 IS IDENTICAL AT 12 AND 18 -- median 1.00x, max 1.08x, clip for clip
#    (foreman 1.00/1.00, bus 1.08/1.08, stefan 1.00/1.00). So nothing is being
#    flattered on the leg that matters most, and the agreement is itself
#    evidence both runs are stable. GOAL 3 IMPROVES: median 1.22x -> 1.17x, max
#    1.38x -> 1.25x, on five of six clips. That gap is the finding: our
#    as-shipped tier loses ~4% going 12 -> 18 where our pure-C tier loses
#    nothing, so part of what goal 3a books as COVERAGE is width-scaling.
#
# NPROC=18 reproduces the old board.
