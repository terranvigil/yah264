# perf-comp-modes.sh -- the RATE-CONTROL MODE MATRIX: yah264 vs x264 across
# CRF, CQP, ABR, CBR, capped VBR and 2-pass, per clip, one table per mode.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The scoreboard (parity-status.sh -> perf-comp-set.sh) has
# only ever run ABR. "Goal 2 is 1.82x" was therefore an ABR number that was not
# labelled one, and the modes are NOT small variations on each other here -- they
# take structurally different paths through the encoder:
#
#   - 2-pass threads as of docs/rc-mode-matrix.md's follow-up: it used to be
#     SERIAL regardless of --threads, because cli/yah264_cli.c routed only
#     `rc.method != 3` to encode_threaded(). That exclusion was load-bearing --
#     the stats file matches records to frames by position with no frame index,
#     so N per-GOP encoders would truncate each other in pass 1 and all replay
#     GOP 0's records in pass 2. It is lifted by splitting the stats file along
#     the GOP boundaries; Y264_2PASS_MT=0 restores the serial path.
#   - VBV (so CBR and capped VBR) drains every in-flight frame at each anchor
#     (encoder.c:9808) and is excluded from the stair width feature by
#     construction (stair_wide_capable :428, stair_wide_rc_ok :455).
#   - CQP and pure CRF are the only modes that set no RC serialisation at all
#     (neither sets rcp_on).
#
# So a single number cannot stand for all six, and this script deliberately
# prints NO cross-mode mean. Report per mode, per clip, or say which you mean.
#
# WHAT MAKES A CELL COMPARABLE. Two traps, both already paid for in this repo:
#
#   1. Equal CRF is not a matched operating point. The two encoders' rate-factor
#      scales are not the same scale (measured on this tree at equal CRF:
#      foreman -10%, bus +9%, park_joy +44%, sintel -55% in size). So the CRF and
#      capped-VBR rows below run each encoder at its OWN calibrated CRF, chosen
#      per clip to land on the same achieved bitrate. The rate factors differ by
#      up to 4.1 points (samsung: yah264 21.4 vs x264 25.5) -- that spread IS
#      the scale difference, made explicit instead of averaged over.
#   2. CQP is not matched work. x264's parameter validation forces mb-tree
#      and aq off whenever the RC method is CQP (the
#      X264_RC_CQP block ~:951-967); yah264 runs mb-tree at EVERY mode
#      (encoder.c:2293 has no rc.method term). The CQP rows here therefore set
#      Y264_MBTREE_OFF=1, which is exactly that policy applied to yah264. AQ
#      needs no action -- cli/yah264_cli.c:885 already zeroes aq_strength when
#      rc.method == 0. Rows are labelled "mbtree-off" so this is never silent.
#
# CALIBRATION. The per-clip CRF/QP constants below were MEASURED by bisection
# against each clip's ABR target on this tree (2026-08-11, 6s windows, medium
# preset). They are a property of the two encoders and go stale when either
# changes -- which is why every row still prints its own achieved rate and the
# harness flags any cell whose two encodes differ by more than 5% in size. A
# stale calibration announces itself as an UNMATCHED cell rather than quietly
# biasing a speed number. Regenerate with the bisection described in
# docs/rc-mode-matrix.md.

# The ABR targets are NOT the old CIF-2500 / 720p-12000 pair. Those put the CIF
# clips at VMAF 99.5-99.9, where the metric has no headroom and a dVMAF column is
# noise around zero (foreman read 99.55 vs 99.61, bus 99.85 vs 99.86), and they
# put ducks at VMAF 75. These targets were chosen from a measured rate/VMAF
# ladder so every clip lands in VMAF ~88-94, where the metric still
# discriminates and where both encoders track their target. See
# docs/rc-mode-matrix.md for the ladder and the selection rule.
