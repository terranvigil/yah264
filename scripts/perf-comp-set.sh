# perf-comp-set.sh -- run the speed comparison over a CLIP SET and print one
# table, because there is no single "the" gap vs x264.
#
# Quoting any one clip as "the gap" is how a 2.5x CIF measurement became a
# campaign headline that a 720p clip then looked like a regression against.
# Report the set, or say which clip you mean.
#
# 2026-08-11: this ran `--ref 1 --bframes 2` on both encoders for years. Those
# overrides predate `--preset medium` matching x264's, and bframes 2 is BELOW
# x264 medium's own default of 3 -- so the headline was quoted at a setting
# neither encoder would choose. It also happened to be near yah264's worst
# case: MT scaling swings 2x with bframes while single-threaded work stays flat
# (bf3/bf7 scale 5-10x and beat x264, bf1/bf2/bf4 scale 3-4x), root-caused to
# pool occupancy in the local measurement records. The overrides are gone;
# both encoders now take the preset's defaults, which is the config a user
# actually gets. NOTE the numbers are NOT comparable to the pre-2026-08-11
# series. The occupancy defect at bframes 2 is understood but NOT fixed -- it
# is simply no longer what the scoreboard measures, which is a reason to keep
# reading the local measurement records, not a reason to consider it closed.

# scales are not the same scale. That is why the size column is printed either

#
# NOTE these numbers are NOT comparable to any earlier series -- this is the
# second discontinuity in one day (the first was dropping --ref 1 --bframes 2).
#
# Rate error is NOT zero at these points and cannot be made zero: x264's own ABR
# undershoots high-motion CIF (bus -8.4%, stefan -15.6% at 400 kbit/s) and
# overshoots ducks (+11.7% at 25000). That is x264's rate control, not
# saturation and not something a target choice fixes, so perf-comp.sh prints the
# signed error for both sides on every ABR row and it should be read, not
# assumed away.

# The PSNR-Y floor. Aggregated by scripts/psnr_leg.py rather than in the block

# identical rule and a formula duplicated across two scoreboards drifts the
# first time one of them is edited -- the same reason parity-clips.sh exists.
#
# READ THIS COLUMN ON THE CRF BOARD, NOT HERE. The owner's leg is PSNR-Y at
# EQUAL BYTES, and ABR only asks both encoders for the same rate -- it does not
# deliver it. x264's own ABR runs +10% on foreman_cif and +4% on bus_cif at the
# calibrated targets, so a dPSNR read on this board carries that gap inside it
# and a clip can drift toward the floor for a rate-control reason with nothing
# in the column saying so. perf-comp-crf-set.sh solves both sides onto a common
# achieved bitrate first (-1.7%..+0.6% across the set), which is where "equal
# bytes" is actually true. The column is printed here anyway because a floor
# that only exists on one board is a floor people forget to look at.
