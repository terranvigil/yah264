"""crf-solve.py -- find the CRF each encoder needs to land on a COMMON operating
point, so a CRF speed comparison is taken at the same place on both RD curves.

WHY THIS EXISTS. yah264's CRF N and x264's CRF N are not the same operating
point and never were. Measured equal-CRF size divergence vs x264 on this tree is
-54.6%..+45.3% shipped, and -29.7%..+11.4% even with Y264_CRF_CPLX=1 -- still 41
points of spread (the local measurement records). So "CRF 25 vs CRF 25" times two
encoders doing different amounts of work, and any speed ratio from it is a
content-luck number. It is the same trap perf-comp.sh's 5%-size guard was added
to catch.

The fix is not to align the two scales. It is to stop needing them aligned:
sweep CRF on each encoder separately, interpolate to a common ACHIEVED bitrate
(or VMAF), and compare speed there. That holds the operating point fixed by
measurement instead of by assuming two integers mean the same thing.

WHAT IS INTERPOLATED, AND WHY THAT WAY ROUND. The obvious reading of "sweep and
interpolate" is: time a ladder of CRF points on each side, then interpolate the
measured SECONDS to the target rate. Don't. Seconds are the noisy quantity here
(the box's own repeatability bound is ~1.15x, which is why perf-comp.sh medians
and warns), and interpolating across a bracket two CRF steps wide multiplies
that noise by the bracket width. Bitrate is the exact quantity -- it is a byte
count.

So this script interpolates the EXACT axis and lets the caller measure the noisy
one directly: it sweeps CRF, interpolates log(rate) vs CRF to solve for the CRF
that hits the target, and lands there. perf-comp.sh then times both encoders AT
the solved point, medianed, with no interpolation on the timing axis at all.
Same operating point, one less noise multiplier.

Interpolation is in log(rate)-vs-CRF because that relation is close to a
straight line over the couple of CRF units a solve moves through (~11-13% rate
per CRF unit), and a secant on a near-linear function converges in 2-3 encodes.
A polynomial fit over a wide ladder buys nothing and rings near saturation.

WHAT THE CALLER GETS. A line of `key=value` pairs, including y264_crf and
x264_crf. Feed those to perf-comp.sh as Y264_CRF / X264_CRF with RC_MODE=crf:
    eval "$(scripts/crf-solve.py --clip ... --target-kbps 400)"
    RC_MODE=crf Y264_CRF=$y264_crf X264_CRF=$x264_crf scripts/perf-comp.sh ...
Because both sides were solved to the same achieved rate, the run satisfies
perf-comp.sh's 5%-size guard BY CONSTRUCTION -- the guard stays armed and
meaningful rather than being suppressed, and the dVMAF it prints becomes a real
quality reading instead of an operating-point artifact.

CALIBRATION REUSE. Solving is done with each encoder's fastest build so the
solve is cheap, and that is exact for yah264 and near-exact for x264. Measured
on this tree (park_joy_720p, 300 frames, CRF 25, preset medium):
  - yah264 WAS bit-identical across {SIMD, no-asm} x {1, 18} threads (all four
    md5s equal) when this was written, and one solve then served all three
    parity goals exactly. The thread half of that is STALE: --threads 1 is now
    its own mode (a flip-first trade disengages there, see CONTRIBUTING's
    engineering rules), so t1 output differs from t2+ and a solve shared across
    tiers leaves the arms rate-MISMATCHED. ffboard.py solves at the tier's own
    thread count for exactly this reason, having measured bbb_720p moving 5.3%
    in achieved size between t8 and auto. The {SIMD, no-asm} half still holds.
  - x264 is NOT: all four md5s differ. The spread is small in the only respect
    that matters here -- size moves 0.023% (asm->noasm, 1t) and 0.125% (1t->18t,
    asm) -- but it is not zero, and perf-comp.sh's header claim that both
    encoders' asm is "bit-exact with their scalar C, so VMAF/size are identical
    either way" is false for x264. Auto-vectorising its floating-point rate control
    reassociates it, and mb-tree decisions move.
    So: x264 is solved at the TIER'S thread count (which carries the 0.125%
    term) using the asm binary (which carries the 0.023% one). The residual is
    ~0.02% of rate, four orders below the 5% guard and two below the solve
    tolerance, and it is bounded rather than assumed.

Usage:

  crf-solve.py --clip ... --target-vmaf 92          # match quality instead
Env: YAH264, X264_ASM, VMAF, Y264_CRF_CACHE=0 to bypass the solve cache.

# yah264's CLI parses --crf into tenths (cli/yah264_cli.c: crf10), so it LOOKS
# continuous. It is not. rc_set_qp_crf (src/encoder/encoder.c) ends in
#     e->qp = (int)lround(qp);
# -- the rate factor collapses to an INTEGER frame QP. Fractional CRF changes
# nothing except when it happens to cross a rounding boundary, so the set of
# achievable bitrates is a discrete ladder one QP step apart. Measured on
# foreman_cif: CRF 21.8/21.9/22.0 all give 416 kbit/s, CRF 22.1/22.3 both give
# 362 -- a 15% jump across a 0.1 CRF change, with a plateau either side.
#
# Two consequences, both load-bearing:
#   1. Secant-searching yah264 on a 0.1 grid is searching a staircase. The
#      first version of this script did exactly that and burned 7 encodes
#      oscillating between two plateaus without converging, while x264 landed in
#      3. Searching on the 1.0 grid instead moves exactly one QP per step and
#      converges monotonically.
#   2. yah264 CANNOT be solved to an arbitrary bitrate in CRF mode at all. The
#      worst-case miss is half a step, ~6-7% of rate, which is OUTSIDE
#      perf-comp.sh's 5% size guard. Forcing a round-number target would
#      therefore trip that guard on roughly half of all clips -- through no
#      fault of the measurement.
#
# So the common point is not a round number we impose. It is chosen from the set
# yah264 can actually reach, and x264 -- whose CRF really is continuous, ~1.4%
# of rate per 0.1 -- is then solved ONTO it. That satisfies the 5% guard by
# construction rather than by suppressing it, and it needs no scale alignment,
# which was the point of moving to a matched operating point in the first place.
