# instr-ratio.sh -- print the INSTRUCTION ratio beside the wall ratio.
#
# Wall is instructions times cycles-per-instruction. A board row that reads
# 1.4x can be 1.4x the work, or the same work at 1.4x the CPI, and those two
# have completely different fixes. the local measurement records made the check
# once by hand (`/usr/bin/time -l` reports instructions retired on macOS) and
# recommended adopting it as a standing companion to every work-factor claim:
# it costs two runs per clip and it is the check that would have caught a
# mislabeled factor a month earlier.
#
# This is deliberately the SIMPLEST possible harness. One run a side, no
# medians -- instruction counts are near-deterministic where wall is not, which
# is the entire reason the check is cheap. If the two ratios track, the row is
# work volume and the fix is to do less. If they diverge, the row is CPI and no
# amount of removed work will collect it.
#
# Pure-C, single thread, ABR at the board's calibrated points, so the numbers
# sit beside the goal-1 row of `make parity-status` and can be read against it.
#
# Usage: scripts/instr-ratio.sh [seconds]
# Env: CLIPS (same format as parity-clips.sh), YAH264, X264_C
