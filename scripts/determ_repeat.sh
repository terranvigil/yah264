# determ_repeat.sh - same binary, same config, same thread count, N times.
# Every run must produce one bitstream.
#
# This is the gate that was missing. The tree's determinism scripts compare
# ACROSS thread counts (stair_determ.sh) or against a reference build
# (w2_canary.sh); nothing re-ran one configuration and compared it with itself,
# so a shipped default spent a day emitting 3-5 distinct bitstreams per 12 runs
# at foreman --ref 1 t18 without any battery noticing. TSan is silent on it --
# the reader was consuming a flag published before the data it advertised, which
# is a happens-before violation TSan can miss when the write lands first often
# enough.
#
# Thread-VARIANT output is allowed here by owner ruling; same-config
# reproducibility is not optional, because every identity gate in this tree
# (escape-env md5 equality, A/B md5 difference, delete probes gated on output
# identity) reads a lottery ticket without it.
#
#   scripts/determ_repeat.sh                       # the default matrix

#   ARM='Y264_B_8X8=1' scripts/determ_repeat.sh    # gate an arm the same way
#   ARGS='--direct temporal' scripts/determ_repeat.sh   # ...or a MODE
#
# ARM is env, ARGS is encoder flags, and they are not interchangeable: a flag in
# the ARM slot makes env(1) reject the whole command, every run then produces
# nothing, and the nothings all have the same md5 -- a clean sweep for an encode
# that never ran. scripts/stair_determ.sh grew the same pair of slots after that
# happened there on 2026-09-01.
