# recon_thread_gate.sh -- recon-match on the THREADED path, which
# scripts/conformance.sh structurally cannot reach.
#
# conformance.sh asks the right question (does the bitstream decode to the
# encoder's own reconstruction?) and answers it only for serial encoding, since
# --dump-recon forces the serial loop. A defect that needs threads on passes all
# 476 of its cases. One did, for six days: RCP_LAG=1 on threaded ABR emitted B
# frames that decode to something the encoder never built.
#
# Every differing frame is a conformance break, not a quality difference.
