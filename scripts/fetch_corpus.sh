# fetch_corpus.sh - download a small set of standard test clips into
# tests/corpus/ for local benchmarking and conformance. Clips are checked
# against known SHA-256 hashes so a corrupted or swapped download fails loudly.
#
# The clips are classic Xiph "derf" test sequences in raw Y4M. They are not
# committed to the repo (see .gitignore); CI conformance uses synthetic clips
# and does not need this. Run it once locally for realistic quality numbers.
#
# Usage: fetch_corpus.sh [--full] [--res] [--review] [--longform]
#   (default)  the 7 CIF clips below -- fast, small, the day-to-day gate.
#   --full     ALSO the large native-res grain/motion/HD clips (class: tier2),
#              which unlock the built-but-unmeasurable features (psy-trellis,
#              b-adapt) and a stable broad-content parity number. GBs of raw Y4M;
#              the harness truncates at encode. See docs/corpus-sources.md.
#   --res      ALSO the resolution-balance set: 6 more at 720p and 6 at 1080p,
#              because the band corpus was 7 CIF / 4x720p / 1x1080p and its
#              median was therefore a CIF decision. ~12 GB. --full implies it.

# Tier 3 (--res, also pulled by --full): the RESOLUTION-BALANCE set.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. The twelve-clip band corpus was 7 CIF, 4x720p and ONE 1080p
# clip, so every "corpus median" was in effect a CIF decision and the whole
# 1080p class rested on touchdown alone -- with no way to tell whether 1080p
# genuinely dislikes an arm or touchdown is peculiar. Six more at each size
# closes that.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. Nothing here may appear in the ML training
# corpus (BVI-AOM) or the train/test split breaks silently. BVI-AOM draws on
# BVI-Texture, IRIS, Harmonics, Videvo, SJTU, MCL-JCV, LIVE-Netflix and Yonsei
# material, so the Netflix 4K set on this same host is OFF LIMITS for gate use
# and so is anything Harmonics-derived. The SVT, TUM and JCT-VC class-E sets
# below appear nowhere in it, checked name by name on 2026-08-30.
#
# Also absent: the aspen / red_kayak / speed_bag / snow_mnt / west_wind_easy /
# rush_field_cuts / controlled_burn group. touchdown_pass comes from that set
# and is the 4:2:2 clip already in the tree, so treat the whole group as
# suspect until a header says otherwise.
