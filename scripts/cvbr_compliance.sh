# cvbr_compliance.sh -- the capped-VBR VBV compliance gate, as a script.
#
# 36 cells: six clips x three caps (0.8x / 0.6x / 0.4x each clip's ABR target)
# x both Y264_RC_PIPE_VBV paths. Plus 18 x264 reference cells at the same caps.
# A cell is clean when scripts/vbv_check.py reports zero underflows.
#
# WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT A COMMAND LINE. This gate produced the numbers in
# the local measurement records (5/36 at HEAD e933296, 34/36 with the fix,
# 18/18 for x264), and it was improvised at a shell prompt both times. The first
# improvisation passed ONE --fps for all six clips, and since the corpus mixes
# 29.97 / 30 / 50 fps that checked the two 50fps clips against a bucket 1.67x
# too forgiving and reported their bitrate 1.67x low. It read 12/36 clean when
# the truth was 5/36 -- the mode was WORSE than the write-up first said, and the
# error flattered it. An uncommitted gate gets re-derived by hand every time
# somebody re-opens the question, and a hand-derived framerate is exactly the
# parameter that keeps coming out wrong.
#
# So: fps is never typed here. vbv_check.py --y4m reads it from the clip's own
# Y4M header, and prints the rate it resolved on every verdict line.
