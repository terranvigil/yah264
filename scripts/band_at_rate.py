"""The CRF band, gated at MATCHED ACHIEVED BITRATE, over the whole corpus.

`run_band.py BANDS=crf` runs its ladder at a matched CRF NUMBER, which is only
sound while the arm leaves the CRF-to-bitrate mapping alone. An arm that moves
the operating point -- anything touching the AQ level, the pedestal or the
mb-tree strength -- measures its own ladder placement there instead of its
efficiency (the local measurement records). `bd_at_rate.py` is the tool for
that case but takes byte targets one clip at a time.

So: the same band ladders `run_band.py` gates on (scripts/ladders.json, in
kbps), converted to byte targets against each clip's own frame rate, run through
`bd_at_rate.py` per clip, several clips at a time. ARM/ARM_ARGS have the same
meaning as in run_band.py, and the A side is the arm.
