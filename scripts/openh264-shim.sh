# openh264-shim.sh -- present Cisco's h264enc behind a yah264/x264-shaped CLI so
# the EXISTING harnesses (scripts/bdcompare.py, scripts/perf-comp.sh) can drive it
# unchanged. Nothing here re-implements a comparison; it is purely an adapter.
#
#   usage: openh264-shim.sh [--qp N | --bitrate K] [--threads N] -o OUT SRC.y4m
#
# WHY AN ADAPTER AND NOT A NEW HARNESS. bdcompare takes free-form command
# templates ({src}/{q}/{out}) and perf-comp takes a binary path, so both already
# generalise to a third encoder. What does NOT generalise is the interface:
# h264enc reads RAW I420 only, needs the dimensions and frame count passed
# explicitly, and takes per-layer arguments. That mismatch is this file.
#
# THE RAW-CONVERSION CACHE IS A CORRECTNESS REQUIREMENT, NOT AN OPTIMISATION.
# perf-comp wall-clocks whatever it invokes. A shim that ran ffmpeg on every call
# would bill y4m->yuv conversion to openh264's encode time and report a slower
# encoder than exists. So the conversion lands in a cache keyed by (src, size,
# mtime) and every timed call hits it. Populate it before timing (any warmup run
# does). The write is atomic because bdcompare encodes 16-way parallel and two
# jobs on one clip would otherwise race on a half-written file.
#
# OPENH264 IS A DIFFERENT DESIGN POINT AND THE ROW MUST SAY SO. It targets
# realtime/WebRTC: NO B-frames at all, no trellis, no mb-tree. Comparing it
# against a B-frame configuration measures that design gap, not implementation
# quality, so drive the other encoders with --bframes 0 for any matched claim.
