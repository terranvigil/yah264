    BD-rate is the mean horizontal gap between two RD curves, integrated with
    UNIFORM weight over the quality interval. Two things it therefore does not
    say, and both matter when quoting a result to anyone who ships a ladder:

      - it weights every operating point equally, and nobody's viewers are
        distributed that way -- the number that matters is the gap at the rungs
        actually shipped, which may be nothing like the average;
      - it converts the whole difference into RATE at matched quality, but a
        real ladder ships fixed rungs, so at each rung the difference arrives
        as a MIX of a little rate and a little quality. BD scores the rate half
        and drops the quality half.

    So print, per rung, both halves: what the arm did to the rate and what it
    did to the score. A reader can then see which half this particular arm is
    paying out in, instead of inferring a bandwidth saving that only exists if
    the ladder is re-cut. (The board's dVMAF leg is the project's other half of
    this; these columns are the same idea per operating point.)

    READ THEM ONLY WHERE THE TWO SIDES SIT AT COMPARABLE RATES -- i.e. a
    self-A/B, where both sides run the same ladder on the same encoder. Against
    x264 the two CRF scales are different operating points (41 points of size
    spread, the local measurement records), so these columns are dominated by that
    offset and NOT by an efficiency difference: bus reads +42-45% rate and
    +2.4-4.5 VMAF against x264 at every rung, which is the scale mismatch, and
    the BD number is the one that normalises it away. The columns and the BD
    number answer different questions and each is misleading in the other's
