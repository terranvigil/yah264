#   720p         ducks park_joy samsung uneven shields parkrun stockholm
#                in_to_tree old_town fourpeople

#                sunflower crowd_run
#   CGI          sintel_720p, and the Big Buck Bunny family:
#                  bbb_416x240  bbb_640x360  bbb_720p
#                  bbb10s_1080p_o120  bbb15s_1080p_o120  bbb30s_1080p_o120
#                (the 10s/15s/30s 1080p cuts differ in LENGTH, not content;
#                 use the 10s one unless you specifically want a longer run)
#   hand-drawn   sita_720p (2D animation; it disagrees with the CGI clips
#                about nearly every arm, so quote which kind you mean)
#   camera, both resolutions, SAME content:
#                perseverance_720p  perseverance_1080p (NASA Mars footage)
#
# bbb and perseverance are the pair the review targets use, because each exists
# at 720p and 1080p, so a resolution comparison changes resolution and nothing
# else, and because one is synthetic and one is a real sensor.

# ratio. Override e.g. make perf-comp-purec PUREC_CLIP=tests/corpus/bus_cif.y4m PUREC_BITRATE=2500
# Default clip: ducks_720p, the set's mid-range clip and the same default as
# perf-comp. The old default (samsung_720p) is the WORST clip of the set, so its

# in the 88-94 band where the metric discriminates); and the args forced
# `--ref 1 --bframes 2`, which the scoreboard dropped for the preset defaults.
# That last one is not cosmetic: at --ref 1 the frame-concurrency machinery
# ENGAGES, and at ref 3 two predicates refuse it (docs/rc-parallel-design.md
# session 17), so the threaded variant was measuring a different encoder.
# Aligned with scripts/perf-comp-set.sh so the numbers are comparable; it stays
